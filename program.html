          			<p><i>The last two decades have meant a radical change in the way information systems are built and consumed. Indeed, the development of the Internet and the cloud computing paradigm has allowed developers to create information systems at different service levels: infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS) and software (SaaS). Service Oriented Computing (SOC) has enabled the construction of systems based on the composition of services deployed at different levels.

						The rise of quantum computing now poses a new challenge for cloud computing and SOC. Future information systems will be hybrids made up of computing elements running both classical and quantum programs that interact with each other. Thanks to the progress of the last two decades, we know that a viable way to integrate such systems is to encapsulate the different computing elements as services.  However, while it is now natural to build complex classical information systems by composing services, the procedures for deploying and integrating quantum services are not yet defined. The reasons for the different treatment of quantum and classical services have multiple causes. On the one hand, different vendors offer their cloud-deployed architectures as IaaS in which quantum programs can be deployed and executed. However, the differences between the architectures and platforms of the different vendors prevent the construction of quantum programs that could be deployed later on a different vendor infrastructure. On the other hand, deploying a quantum program on a current quantum computer as a service is not possible. First, the operating system of quantum computers does not yet support the possibility of having multiple active programs at the same time, so it makes it impossible to replicate the common situation in classical SOC of having several services provided by the same server. This fact supposes a huge limitation for using quantum infrastructures and platforms. In addition, a quantum service would require encapsulated code to be deployed and actively waiting for interactions. We are still far from considering this kind of behavior in quantum computing entities. Thus, having quantum services deployable in different providers and that can be consumed by different users still seems a remote possibility. Finally, the inherent characteristics of quantum computing such as entanglement, superposition or collapse are not addressed by either Cloud Computing or classical SOC. New mechanisms will be needed to handle these features, for example to entangle qbits in a service, in its different instances, in its different executions, or simply to make service orchestration possible without quantum services collapsing.

          			<p><i>Among the various challenges that quantum computing faces to become a widespread reality are, on the one hand, the need to research and apply the existing software engineering processes; and on the other hand, the shortage of specialized workforce. <a href="https://www.quantumpath.es/">QPath</a>&reg; is a tool that solves these two challenges, in addition to presenting other advantages for the development of hybrid information systems. In this paper we present the Annealer Compositor that facilitates the definition and execution of annealing algorithms in either quantum annealing or digital annealing computers.</i></p>

          			<p><a href="./speakers.html#speakerKilber">Natalie Kilber</a></p>
          			<p><i>Cybersecurity is preparing for what is next, yet it is often an afterthought. With the regularity of security breaches and the rising cyberattack frequency and range impacting academia and especially, an array of industries, Quantum Computing groups, companies and institutions may become targets for nation-state actors, APTs or cybercriminals for ransomware and data theft as the Quantum computing race intensifies. It is an imperative to build in security during the design phase and therefore shift security left to ensure Quantum Computing ecosystems, services, as well as promising technologies are reliable and secure to use. 
					This session will bring you up-to-speed on the field of cybersecurity, including types of cyberattacks and it’s growing global importance in a digital world bridging from research to industry. This workshop raises questions on how to secure the future of Quantum Software Engineering

          			<p><a href="./speakers.html#speakerVerdugo">Javier Verdugo</a>, Moisés Rodríguez and Mario Piattini</p>
          			<p><i>Quantum computing is the technology of the 21st century. Quantum computers and environments are already offering great advantages when building advanced applications in finance, health, or logistics. However, if industry is to boost the large-scale production of quantum software, an adequate quality level must be achieved and assured. In this sense, it is very important to consider quantum software quality platforms and products, and to create an effective quality environment for quantum software. This paper summarises some of these issues.</i></p>

          			<p><i>Quantum software engineering is still a new area, with different amount of research dedicated to each subarea, with very little for requirements reasearch. We'll cover some low level constraints that have to be taken into account when developing quantum programs for real quantum devices that can be potentially translated into non-functional requirements. Then, we'll proceed to review the different approaches for high level abtractions that deal with these constraints when executing on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computing (NISQs), such as quantum volume, quantum provenance, compilers and transpilers.</i></p>

          			<p><i>As the quantum software matures, the quantum codebases grow in size and complexity, and so does the task of testing them and verifying their correctness. In this session we’ll show how to test and validate several common types of quantum programs written in the quantum programming language Q# using the tools provided by the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit. Our approach uses multiple simulators and library tools for program testing and resource estimation, performing these steps before running the programs on quantum hardware. The demonstrated approach is illustrated with code examples from the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/">Quantum Katas</a>, a collection of quantum programming tutorials that provide immediate feedback for the learner’s solution.</i></p>
